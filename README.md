# dictionary

Your project: Create a program that lets users create a dictionary.

category/task

Make two classes: one for category, and one for task. The homepage of the app should list out all of the categories, and let you click on them to view all of their tasks. A user should be able to add a category, and when viewing a category, be able to add one or more tasks.

Don't forget your Git commits and README!

When you have reviewed your code for all of the objectives, submit your code to the Java OO Code Review on Epicenter.

Objectives:

All previous standards are in place from previous code reviews
An instance of one class appears in the method of another class
Spark routes process GET and POST requests/responses successfully
Objects are created from a custom class with a custom constructor
Object unit tests are organized into their own files separate from integration tests
